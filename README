Short description of Xrus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Xrus - program for switching two keyboard layouts with a hot key
combination. It also serves as autolock.

It can be compiled with Motif, Lesstif, Xaw or without any widget library.
In the later case it won't show its icon with keyboard indicator.

It gets all keyboard and mouse events; when a particular hot key
combination is pressed, it swaps 1,2 and 3,4 columns of keyboard map. (if
keyboard map has more than 4 columns, it swaps halves). When a timeout
without keyboard and mouse events passes, it starts a locker.
