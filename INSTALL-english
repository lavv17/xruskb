   *  On some  systems  you may  also  want  to change  default
background or delete it from Xrus.ad (e.g. on Dec Alpha)

   * Run ./configure. It should find Motif library and headers.
If Motif is not found, configure looks for Xaw library. If none
of the  libraries were found, xrus  can still be  compiled, but
you would lose the GUI. If you have Motif but want to save some
memory, try 'configure --without-motif --without-Xaw'. You will
not see the icon then, though.

   * Run  make. If all  went ok,  type `make install'.  You may
also  want to  copy  the file  Xrus.ad  to system  app-defaults
directory,  renaming it  to Xrus,  although  the resources  are
compiled in.

   * If you  have troubles compiling the program,  feel free to
write to me (lav@yars.free.net).  Please include your operating
system  type/version,  the  compiler you  used,  precise  error
messages.
